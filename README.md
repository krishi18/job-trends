ChatGPT (GPT-5, OpenAI, accessed November 2025) — assisted in documentation drafting, debugging explanations, and conceptual understanding.

Google Gemini (accessed November 2025) — used for comparative insights and validation of generated code logic.

Perplexity AI (accessed November 2025) — used for quick factual verification and alternative perspectives.

Applied Database Technologies – Class Notes (2025) — served as a key academic reference for SQL concepts, normalization, and data modeling guidance.
